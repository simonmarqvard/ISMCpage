  <h3>ABOUT INSTITUTE OF SPORTS MEDICINE COPENHAGEN</h3>
  <p>
    Institute of Sports Medicine Copenhagen (ISMC) is a joint research institute
    and out-patient clinic. In the out-patient clinic we treat approximately
    10,000 patients each year, all with conditions/injuries in the
    musculoskeletal system caused by physical/sports activities at all levels
    ranging from recreational to elite athletes. Institute of Sports Medicine
    was established in 1997 at the Department of Rheumatology at Bispebjerg
    Hospital in conjunction with the establishment of a professorship in Sports
    Medicine at University of Copenhagen given to Professor Michael Kjaer.
  </p>
  <p>
    At ISMC the main research focus is the adaption of tendon and muscle
    connective tissue to acute and chronic mechanical loading. The overall aim
    of the research is to investigate how the muscle-tendon unit adapts to
    short-term and long-term alterations in mechanical loading including that
    associated with physical training, inactivity and immobilization in
    conjunction with injury and aging. In particular, we focus on the adaption
    of tendon and connective tissue of the muscle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our long-term vision is that our research outcomes will improve the
    treatment of work and physical activity related injuries in the connective
    tissue of the muscle-tendon unit. These types of injuries are the cause of a
    considerable number of all lost working days in Denmark.
  </p>
  <p>
    At ISMC we have established a very solid track record in translational
    research in adaptation of muscle and connective tissue to acute and chronic
    mechanical loading, immobilization, aging and pharmaceutical interventions.
    We have a strong tradition of innovative, multidisciplinary and integrative
    research within the areas of musculo-skeletal physiology, injury pathology
    and treatment thereof. Our translational research activity is further
    strengthened by spearheading the Clinical Academic Group “Physical Activity
    and Sports in Clinical Medicine”, Copenhagen Health Science Partners, which
    is a joint venture between the Capital Region hospital system and University
    of Copenhagen.
