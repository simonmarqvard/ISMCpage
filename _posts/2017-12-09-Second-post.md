I decided to try to replicate one of the illustrations that was provided on the website, as I imagined it would contain many of the functions we went over in class as well as conditions, if statements and loops.

The image shows the illustration by Rune. It is a shape where you can drag each corner to a new location and the coordinates will update accordingly on the right side.
