    <p class="news-title">The winner of the Annual Symposium PhD Cup 2019 has been found</p>
    <p class="news-date">29. November 2019</p>

  <div class="blogImage"><img src="../images/blogImages/phd-cup-winner-2019.png" /></div>
  <p>On Thursday November 28th 2019 the yearly PhD Cup during the Annual Symposium of the “Basic and Clinical Research in Musculo-skeletal Sciences” took place.</p>

<p>Karina Louise Skov Husted was announced as the winner with her project titled “A new approach to workplace health promotion: Body age assessment in 9851 Danish employees – a cohort study”. Karina was chosen as the winner because she very convincingly explained how body age determination can help promote health-span increasing activities. In a large follow-up study activities which increases health-span was effectively increased, when the participants were informed about their body age.</p>

<p>Karina was chosen to participate in the PhD Cup based on her abstract:</p>

<p>Objectives: A discrepancy between the consensus that workplaces are an optimal setting for health promotion and the lack of clinical relevant effect exists. This study explores the effectiveness of body age assessment in workplace health promotion.</p>

<p>Methods: Body age tests were performed in 9851 Danish employees. Metabolic risk factors were assessed, body age score was determined and an individualized motivational interview was conducted at baseline and follow-up. The body age score is a composite score comprising 11 weighted variables.</p>

<p>Results: At baseline 70% (n=9852) participated, and 38% (n=3759) participated at follow-up. At 1.3 years follow-up the body age improved by a decline in mean body age score of -0.6 and -0.7 years for men and women, respectively (p&lt;0.001) representative of an overall improvement in general health. 60% of the smokers had reduced their tobacco use and 41% had quitted smoking (p&lt;0.001). Weight and waist circumference was reduced and cholesterol profile improved for both men and women.</p>

<p>Conclusions: Body age assessment was related to high participation rate, high impact on attenuation of tobacco use and small to moderate changes in metabolic risk factors.</p>
