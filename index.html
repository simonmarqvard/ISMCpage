      <strong>Institute of Sports Medicine Copenhagen </strong> (ISMC) is a
      joint research institute and out-patient clinic. In the out-patient clinic
      we treat approximately 10,000 patients each year, all with
      conditions/injuries in the musculoskeletal system caused by
      physical/sports activities at all levels ranging from recreational to
      elite athletes. Institute of Sports Medicine was established in 1997 at
      the Department of Rheumatology at Bispebjerg Hospital in conjunction with
      the establishment of a professorship in Sports Medicine at University of
      Copenhagen given to Professor Michael Kjaer.

      At ISMC the main research focus is the adaption of tendon and muscle
      connective tissue to acute and chronic mechanical loading. The overall aim
      of the research is to investigate how the muscle-tendon unit adapts to
      short-term and long-term alterations in mechanical loading including that
      associated with physical training, inactivity and immobilization in
      conjunction with injury and aging. In particular, we focus on the adaption
      of tendon and connective tissue of the muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our long-term vision is that our research outcomes will improve the
      treatment of work and physical activity related injuries in the connective
      tissue of the muscle-tendon unit. These types of injuries are the cause of
      a considerable number of all lost working days in Denmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ISMC we have established a very solid track record in translational
      research in adaptation of muscle and connective tissue to acute and
      chronic mechanical loading, immobilization, aging and pharmaceutical
      interventions. We have a strong tradition of innovative, multidisciplinary
      and integrative research within the areas of musculo-skeletal physiology,
      injury pathology and treatment thereof. Our translational research
      activity is further strengthened by spearheading the Clinical Academic
      Group “Physical Activity and Sports in Clinical Medicine”, Copenhagen
      Health Science Partners, which is a joint venture between the Capital
      Region hospital system and University of Copenhagen.
